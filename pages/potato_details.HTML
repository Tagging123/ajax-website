  <h1 class="Heading">What's a Potatoes</h1>
  <p class="para1">
    The potato (Solanum tuberosum) is a perennial plant of the Solanaceae, or nightshade, family, commonly grown for its starchy tuber. Potatoes are the world's most widely grown tuber crop, and the fourth largest crop in terms of fresh produce (after rice, wheat, and maize), but this ranking is inflated due to the high water content of fresh potatoes relative to that of other crops. The potato originated in South America, somewhere in present-day Chile or Peru. Potatoes are important to the culture of the Andes, where farmers grow many different varieties that have a remarkable diversity of colors and shapes. Potatoes spread to the rest of the world after European contact with the Americas in the late 1400s and early 1500s and have since become an important field crop.

  <h1 class="Heading">Cultivation</h1>
  <p class="para2">Potatoes can be cultivated in a variety of soil types, including loamy soil, sandy loam, silt loam, and clay soil. Soil should be loose in order to provide less resistance to tuber enlargement. The soil must be fertile and well-drained. Potato cultivation requires acidic soil with a pH range of 4.8 to 5.4. The potato is classified as a cool-weather crop.Potato vegetative growth is best at temperatures of 24 degrees Celsius, and tuber growth is best at temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius.<br><br>

    Potato seed/tuber must be kept in a cool, shady place for one to two weeks after being removed from cold storage to allow sprouts to emerge. Tubers can be treated with Gibberellic acid 1g/lit of water and then dried in a shady place before being kept in an aerated chamber for 10 days to achieve uniform sprouts. To prevent tuber rotting, soak tubers in a 0.5 percent Mancozeb solution for 10 minutes.
