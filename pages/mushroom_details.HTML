  <h1 class="Heading">What's a Mushroom</h1>
  <p class="para1">
    Mushroom is the reproductive structure produced by some fungi. It is somewhat like the fruit of a plant, except that the "seeds" it produces are in fact millions of microscopic spores that form in the gills or pores underneath the mushroom's cap. The spores blow away into the wind, or are spread by other means, such as animal feeding. If they land on a suitable substrate (such as wood or soil) spores will germinate to form a network of microscopic rooting threads (mycelium) which penetrate into their new food source. Unlike the mushroom, which pops up then passes away quickly, the mycelium persists, often for many years, extracting nutrients and sending up its annual crop of mushrooms.

  <h1 class="Heading">Cultivation</h1>
  <p class="para2">Mushrooms grow on compost. The compost is produced at specialized companies. From the moment the raw materials are mixed, up to delivery of the compost to the mushroom farms. The process takes four to six weeks, depends depending on the raw materials and the system used at the Compost yard.<br><br>

    When the compost has been delivered at the mushroom farm, it still takes 16 to 20 days before a start can be made with mushroom harvesting. Harvesting takes place during two to three weeks. After this it is no longer cost-effective to harvest.
